Stage 1 Essay

This week on HackBio's Data Visualization with R

First I learned about some basic R syntax including how to assign values to variable and taking note some of the illegal variable names. Then I explored more on the data types and structures. I learned how to manually create a dataframe or by combining multiple vectors. Then, I was able to import and play around the bacteria dataset which have columns of different types. Next, I learned about loops and conditions and created custom function that calculate the percentage of GC content in a nucleotide sequence. I also explored some built-in functions in R and install some R packages.

For the second task of the assignment, we are asked to make a function that calculates the molecular weight of any protein. The first step is to ask for input protein 'input_protein'. This could be any sequence of letters and I assume it can either be in upper or lower case. Since we want our function to be robust and consider upper and lower case as the same, I converted the input_protein to upper case
